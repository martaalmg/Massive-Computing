# Due a bug in the multiprocessing module implemented for Windows Operating System, the functions which will be executed in the parallel threads MUST be implemented in a separated file, and import them in the main programs.
# 
# In order to be loaded in you own program, you have to write your own functions here, and export to a python ".py" file, to be imported in  the main script.
# 
# To export to a python file, select in the *File*  menu, the option *Download as* and save as *Python .py* file.
